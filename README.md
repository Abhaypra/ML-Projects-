# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

**An intelligent and interactive movie recommendation system built using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit.**
It analyzes the content of movies using Natural Language Processing techniques like **Bag of Words (BoW)** and recommends similar movies based on user input.

## 📖 Project Description

This project helps users discover movies similar to the ones they love. By using a content-based filtering approach, the system combines the movie’s overview and genre to create a feature vector using the **Bag of Words** model. It then computes the similarity using **Cosine Similarity**, allowing the system to recommend movies that share similar descriptions and themes.

The model is trained and stored using **Pickle** and deployed as a web app using **Streamlit**, making it easy to interact with the recommendation system in real-time.

## ⚙️ Features

* 🔍 Content-based recommendations
* 🧠 Uses BoW for feature extraction and Cosine Similarity for matching
* 🧾 Clean and intuitive UI with Streamlit
* 💾 Lightweight model storage with Pickle
* ⚡ Fast, responsive, and easy to use
